**PROJECT TITLE** - EXTRACTIVE TEXT SUMMARIZATION ALGORITHM USING NLP

**INTRODUCTION** - We attempt to summarize articles by selecting a subset of words that retain the most important points.

**PURPOSE** - Want to contribute to text summarization in NLP. This a very easy-to-understand NLP technique and good beginner friendly.

**BRIEF EXPLANATION** - Summarization can be defined as the task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning.

**WORKING CONDITIONS**-

1. Input document
2. sentences similarity
3. weight sentences
4. select sentences with a higher rank.

**USAGE** -This approach weights the important part of sentences and uses the same to form the summary. Different algorithms and techniques are used to define weights for the sentences and further rank them based on importance and similarity among each other.

**USE CASES** - Here are a few use cases:

1. In scientific paper summarization, there is a considerable amount of information such as cited papers and conference information which can be leveraged to identify important sentences in the original paper.
2. Even legal summarization works in a similar manner. Legal text summarization is a process of generating summaries from court judgments.
3. Scanning text documents and summarizing them by identifying key entities in the document. A popular use case resume categorization, wherein the NER processes a large number of resumes and highlights key entities such as name, institution, and skills, which facilitates quick evaluation.

**LIBRARIES USED** -

NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit library (NLTK) is one of the most popular Python libraries for natural language processing.

NLTK corpora: NLTK allows users to access over 50 corpora(a large body of text/linguistic data) and lexical(database containing corpus/ dictionaries) resources.
Tokenize: splits a document into a list of units. These units could be words, alphabets, or sentences.
WordNet Lemmatizer: WordNet is a lexical database of English that is freely and publicly available. As part of WordNet, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing distinct concepts. These synsets are interlinked using lexical and conceptual semantic relationships. It can be easily downloaded, and the nltk library offers an interface to it that enables you to perform lemmatization.

**ADVANTAGES** - Here are a few advantages:

Summarizing reduces perusing time.
While investigating reports, outlines make the determination procedure simpler.
Summarization improves the adequacy of ordering.
Summarization calculations are less one-sided than human summarizers.

**DISADVANTAGES** - some sentiments of the text may be missed.

**APPLICATIONS** -

1. scientific paper summarization
2. Legal text summarization
3. Scanning text documents and summarizing them by identifying key entities in the document.
4. resume categorization

**CONCLUSION** - We will learn to build a basic text summarizer that uses the extractive summarization technique.
