# **LOGISTIC REGRESSION**
 
Logistic Regression is a SUPERVISED ML algorithm which uses labelled data.
It is highly used for classification tasks & projects.

**GOAL**
The goal is to use and understand this algorithm using a project as water poratabilty prediction.


**PURPOSE**
 To give a clear undertanding of what logistic regression is all about, its use cases, advantages, disadvantages, working etc.


**DATASET** 

for the dataset being used [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability)


**DESCRIPTION**

Let's understand this algorithm with help of a project i.e. water portability prediction where we have to classify the target variable 'Potability' which
Indicates if water is safe for human consumption or not as 0 or 1.

Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.
