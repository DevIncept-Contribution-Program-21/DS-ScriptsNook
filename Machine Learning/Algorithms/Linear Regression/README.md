## **LINEAR REGRESSION**

**INTRODUCTION**
- Linear regression is a **SUPERVISED** machine learning algorithm which uses labelled data.
-  When we use linear regression the data is generally labelled i.e. both input data and output data are provided to the model so that it can learn from the data and then perform accordingly.

**PURPOSE**

The main prupose is to give a clear understanding on what linear regression algorithm is all about, its working, usage, libaries used, advantages, disadvantages etc.

**BRIEF EXPLANATION**
- Linear Regression is a **SUPERVISED** machine learning algorithm which uses labelled data. 
- It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables.
- It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables,regression tasks & various prediction projects. 
- Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.

**WORKING CONDITIONS**
1.  Data preprocessing and exploration to understand what kind of data will we working on.
2.  Data visualization to draw insights and get better underdstanding on different columns present in the dataset
3.  Data training using train-test-split method from sklearn to split the data into training and testing data & Model creation using linear regression algorithm. 
4.  Checking performance by error and accuracy check to find how efficient algorithm performed for this project.

**USAGE**
- Linear regression is one of the basic and simplest machine learning algorithm.
- It is basically used for REGRESSION TASKS

**USE CASES**
- Regression tasks
- Prediction projects.
- Used in projects where the data has linear relationship.

**LIBRARIES USED**
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- numpy

**ADVANTAGES**
- Simple
- Easy to understand
- Good for regression tasks
- Used in prediction projects etc.

**DISADVANTAGES**
- Relationship between features should be well understood or else it might give low performance efficiency.
- It is Limited to Linear Relationships only.
- Can give low accuracy if features are not identified properly.
- Cannot be used for classification projects.

**APPLICATIONS**
- Used in Prediction projects.
- Used in different regression tasks.
- Can help in improving business plan by providing fruitful insights and prediction analysis.

**CONCLUSION**
*   Linear regression is generally used for dependent-independent relationship of columns in the dataset.

*   Linear regression should be used for labelled data & prediction of a target column given with some features on which it depends.

*   It is useful in regression tasks & various prediction algorithms.

*   It Can help in improving business plan by providing fruitful insights and prediction analysis.
